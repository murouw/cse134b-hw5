# Enhancements

## Clean up
I cleaned up extraneous code that wasn't being used, mainly in the CSS so that it wasn't redundant. Additionally, I made sure that my units were relative so that the CSS was more cohesive as a whole. There were also some small errors in the HTML and JS that I was able to get rid of in this iteration, such as allowing " " to be entered as a character in the name. 

## Formatting
I made some changes to the formatting, mainly on the navigation bar, because there were some issues with how it was formatted when menu items were condensed into the hamburger menu. Additionally, I made the homepage cleaner by making sure that the only thing the user sees upon landing is the name and occupation instead of a partial view of the form as well. 

## Content
In the best-case scenario, I can put this website on my resume to show to potential recruiters, so I wanted to make sure that it was more professional. To this end, I decided to get rid of the GIF on the home page and replaced it with a typewriter animation that types out various information about me to add some flavor to the website while keeping it professional. Additionally, I replaced the old meme logo with a more professional one on both the nav bar and favicon.
